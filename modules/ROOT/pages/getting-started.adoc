= Getting Started

This repo contains the files that you need to start a new Neo4j documentation project.

== antora.yml

- `name:` - replace `docs-template` with the name of the project as it will appear in the URL https://neo4j.com/docs/<PROJECT_NAME>`, for example 'getting-started', 'cypher-manual'.
- `title:` - the title of the manual, for example Getting Started Guide, Cypher Manual. This value is displayed in the breadcrumbs above each page.
- `version:` - the version of the content that is generated from the branch containing this `antora.yml` file.

Optionally, you can add the following attributes:

- `display_version:` - Use this attribute when you want the version that is displayed in your content and in the UI to be different from the version that appears in the URL. For example, you might want to use _/2.0/_ in URLs, but display the version as `2.0-beta` in the version selector drop-down.
- `prerelease:` - if you publish multiple versions of this project, you can mark a version as being a prerelease, by adding `prerelease: true`. The content is published alongside the other versions, but does not appear in the drop-down version selector, and is not included when Antora is calculating the default (or 'latest') version in order to resolve links between pages. For more information, see link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/component-prerelease/[Antora Docs -> Identify a Prerelease Version]

== preview.yml

Antora uses a link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/playbook/[playbook] to determine what content is included in a site, and the appearance of that content.

In our projects, we use `preview.yml` as the default playbook name.

Update the `start_page` attribute to match the value of the `name` attribute in your `antora.yml` file.

----
site:
  start_page: docs-template:ROOT:index.adoc
----

Update the information for the sitemap extension:

----
antora:
  extensions:
  - require: "@neo4j-antora/antora-modify-sitemaps"
    sitemap_version: '1.0'
    sitemap_loc_version: 'current'
    move_sitemaps_to_components: true
----

The link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neo4j-antora/antora-modify-sitemaps[`antora-modify-sitemaps`] Antora extension generates sitemaps for Neo4j docs that include information about the current release only, and makes sure those sitemaps are included in the right output folder when the HTML is built.
In this example, a sitemap file would be generated at _build/site/docs-template/1.0/sitemap.xml_.
Change the value of `sitemap_version` to the 'current' release version of your project.
For example, Neo4j manuals such as the Getting Started Guide or Cypher Manual use 4.4 as their current version, so for those manuals this is set as `sitemap_version: '4.4`.

== [Optional] Add an 'Edit this page' link

If your repo is public, you can add an `Edit this page` link to your pages to encourage external contributors, and to provide a quick way for users to suggest changes.

Update the following attribute in your playbook:

----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    page-origin-private: false
----

== [Optional] Add a 'preview' note to each page

When we publish preview content to either development or production environments, we prepend an admonition to every page to make it clear that this is preview content, for example, as in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/2.0-preview/[Graph Data Science 2.0-preview].

You can use the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neo4j-antora/antora-add-notes[antora-add-notes] extension to add content to your pages.
Follow the Usage instructions in the package documentation.
